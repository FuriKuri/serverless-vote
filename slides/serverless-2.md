> "Serverless was first used to describe applications that significantly or fully depend on 3rd party applications / services (â€˜in the cloudâ€™) to manage server-side logic and state."
> - Mike Roberts (@mikebroberts)


> "Serverless architecture is an approach that replaces long-running virtual machines with ephemeral compute power that comes into existence on request and disappears immediately after use."
> - ThoughtWorks Tech Radar


> "... specific business logic and implement it in Lambda functions ... WITHOUT DEPLOYING A SINGLE SERVER!"
> - Ant Stanley (@IamStan)


> "If your PaaS can efficiently start instances in 20ms that run for half a second, then call it serverless."
> - Adrian Cockcroft (@adrianco)


> "Can we please rename #serverless to #faas? Functions as a Service. The term "Serverless" is a misnomer."
